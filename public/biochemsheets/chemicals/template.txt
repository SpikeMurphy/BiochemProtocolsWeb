Ideas for a template:

1. Core Identification (always at the top)
These help people quickly confirm they have the right chemical.
Common name (headline)
IUPAC name
Other names / synonyms
Abbreviations
CAS number ⭐ (very important for ordering & databases)
Chemical formula
Molar mass
👉 Tip: Put CAS + formula in a compact box for fast scanning.
2. Physical & Chemical Properties (praxis-relevant)
Focus on what affects handling, storage, and experimental design.
Physical state (RT) (solid/liquid/gas)
Appearance (color, crystalline, oily, hygroscopic, etc.)
Melting point / boiling point
Density (for liquids)
Solubility
In water (with temp dependence if relevant)
In common lab solvents (EtOH, MeOH, DMSO, acetone, buffers)
pKa / pH relevance ⭐ (critical for buffers, acids, bases)
Stability
Light sensitive?
Air / moisture sensitive?
Temperature sensitive?
Hygroscopic / deliquescent (huge practical importance)
3. Solvents & Preparation (very praxisnah)
This is often what people actually search for.
Recommended solvents
Possible alternative solvents
Typical stock solution concentrations
Solubility limits
Notes on dissolution
Heating required?
Sonication?
Adjust pH?
Compatibility with buffers (PBS, Tris, HEPES, etc.)
👉 Example:
Dissolves readily in water; poorly soluble in ethanol; stock solutions typically prepared at 100 mM in H₂O, pH adjusted after dissolution.
4. Safety & Handling (keep it practical, not legalistic)
Avoid copying full SDS text—summarize what matters at the bench.
GHS pictograms
Signal word (Danger / Warning)
Most relevant hazard statements (H-phrases)
Key safety notes (Kurzfassung) ⭐
Toxic if inhaled?
Corrosive?
Neurotoxic?
Carcinogenic?
PPE recommendations
Spill / exposure notes (very short)
Waste disposal category
🇩🇪 Since you used Sicherheitshinweise:
You may also include Kurzfassung in German, even if the rest is English.
5. Storage & Shelf Life (extremely useful)
Often overlooked but highly valued.
Recommended storage temperature
Light protection needed?
Moisture protection?
Typical shelf life
Solid
In solution
Freeze–thaw stability
6. Use Cases & Applications (learning + lab)
This is where your factsheets really shine.
Primary lab uses
Buffer component
Enzyme cofactor
Reducing agent
Denaturant
Fixative, stain, inhibitor, etc.
Typical concentrations used
Relevant techniques
SDS-PAGE
Western blot
Enzyme assays
Cell culture
Protein purification
Biochemical role (if applicable)
7. Common Mistakes & Tips
This is gold for students and early-career researchers.
Common preparation errors
Incompatibilities
Degradation traps
“Do not mix with …”
pH-related pitfalls
Example:
Do not autoclave; decomposes under high temperature. Prepare fresh solutions.
8. Learning Section (optional but powerful)
Especially useful for subscriptions.
Why this chemical is important in biochemistry
Mechanism of action (short, schematic)
Typical exam questions / misconceptions
Comparison to similar compounds
9. Quick Reference Box (1-glance summary) "at the top"
Perfect for mobile users.
At a glance:
